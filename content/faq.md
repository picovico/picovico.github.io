###I already have a Picovico Account, can I still login using Facebook account?

Yes, you can link your Picovico account with your Facebook account. Click on &ldquo;Login with Facebook&rdquo; and enter your Facebook login details to link both the accounts. This way you can log in to Picovico using either &ldquo;Login with Facebook&rdquo; or &ldquo;Log In&rdquo;.

###How long does it take to make a video?

Generally it takes 1-2 minute to process a video. But at times it may take longer depending upon the style you chose.
	
	
###What is the maximum length of video that I can make?

At present we are limiting the maximum numbers of photo uploads per video to 30. This will yield a video of maximum 3 minutes. Drop us a mail at [ineedit@picovico.com](ineedit@picovico.com) if you need beyond this.
	
	
###What is the quality of video?

We currently serve 360p(SD) videos. In other words, it&rsquo;s a YouTube standard quality video. And 720p(HD) for premium users.
	
	
###Can I add my own music into the video?

Yes, in the music selection step, upload your own music to embed it. We will also save that music in your Picovico music library (available only to you) so that you can use it later for other videos as well. Alternatively you can delete it, if you don&#39;t want us to save the music.

*Make sure you have the right to use the music.*

	
	
###I have created a video, but I haven&#39;t received any notification?

If you haven&#39;t received the notification email despite waiting reasonably long, please check your &ldquo;Spam&rdquo; folder. If you still don&rsquo;t find the mail, notify us via feedback.
	
	
###Can I change the style of my video once I&#39;ve created it?

Yes, you can edit your video as many times as you wish. And you can change the video style too.
	
	
###How can I download my video?

You can also change the privacy of your video anytime. Just go to your video page and click on the &quot;Video Settings&quot; -&gt; &quot;Privacy Settings&quot;

	
###Can I reuse the photos used in my previous videos?

In case your video length is longer than the length of music used, the same piece of music will get repeated in the video.
